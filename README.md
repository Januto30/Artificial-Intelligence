# AI Search Algorithms

This section of the Artificial Intelligence repository focuses on the implementation of various search algorithms used to solve optimization, pathfinding, and decision-making problems. These algorithms form the backbone of many AI systems, enabling intelligent navigation through complex problem spaces.

## What's Inside?  
- **Uninformed Search Algorithms:**  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
  - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)  

- **Informed Search Algorithms:**  
  - A* Search  
  - Greedy Best-First Search  

- **Optimization and Problem Solving:**  
  - Implementation of heuristics for efficient search.  
  - Solving pathfinding and state-space problems.
